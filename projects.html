                            I worked on Ball Bully as a core-mechanic developer and designer, during the
                            development of the game. For this game I integrate the previously developed joystick based
                            aim
                            controller which I later converted into a modular system. The most challenging part during
                            the
                            development phase was to develop unique trap system for interfere the group of enemies.

                            the development phase. As the building block of the game I used the modular drawing mechanic
                            I had
                            already implemented for the first drawing game "Combo Coins". The most challenging
                            integration I had
                            to face in the project was to create a sprite divider which splits the sprite to pixel
                            images which
                            later can be used for the painting mechanic of the game.
